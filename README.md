# What is Exponential?

## What is Exponential Starter Distribution

The Exponential Starter Distribution or ESD is made up of a default installation of Exponential preconfigured for immediate use. It's settings come configured to load the default installation withour any configuration required. The database is configured to use a small SQLite Database in the var/storage/sqlite3/starter.db relative path with the document root (software installation).

### What is the default 'admin' Password?

The default 'admin' user password is 'publishing' (without the quotes) in the preconfigured default SQLite Database starter.db file provided by the ESD.

Note: The original default password is still 'publish' upstream but after runing the setup wizard, the admin password requirements of the software, prevent this password by default as too short and thus insecure.

### Exponential Unbreakable

We strongly recommend placing the admin siteaccess under a HostMatch=host;uri configuration, web server virtual host (acccess) with a htpassword / htacccess password login prompt configuration in your virtual host configuration (conf / .htaccess file) to ensure your site is virtually unhackable (double login; two different accounts). Security experts have been preaching this configuration based security solution for decades. This step requires addition user configuration and thought.

## Recent improvements to Exponential
Exponential (the application of interest) delivered to users worldwide by a web server (PHP built-in, Apache, Nginx, lighttpd, Among others).

Exponential with a full complement of all popular and available php extensions installed like SQLite3 users no longer require a dedicated database server anymore with Exponential 6.

With PHP we require composer to install Exponential software and no other software required to run
the application. This is an incredible improvement to the kernel (core) of Exponential.

## What does Exponential provide for end users building websites?

Exponential is a professional PHP application framework with advanced CMS (content management system) functionality. As a CMS its most notable feature
is its fully customizable and extendable content model.
It is also suitable as a platform for general PHP development, allowing
you to develop professional Internet applications, fast.

Standard CMS functionality, like news publishing, e-commerce and forums is
built in and ready for you to use. Its stand-alone libraries can be
used for cross-platform, secure, database independent PHP projects.

Exponential is database, platform and browser independent. Because it is
browser based it can be used and updated from anywhere as long as you have
access to the Internet.

(Referred to as `legacy` in Exponential Platform 5.x and Ibexa OSS)

# Requirements
- PHP
- (Optional) Web server. Used to deliver the website to the end user.
- (Optional) Database server. Used to store website content (and application information)
- Composer. Used to download Exponential software packages for installation, also notebly installs the required Zeta Components php libraries.
- Computer to run the PHP website application.

## What version of PHP is required

Exponential Legacy supports PHP 8.1 -> 8.5+ please use the latest version of PHP available on your OS.

PHP 7 Support is deprecated but still available from our older stable and usable past releases up to version 6.0.7.

Developer note: PHP 7 support can be regained at any time by reverting php8.1 specific code changes in very small number of class function definitions. That said. 7x stronly recommends you to upgrade and leverage the latest PHP 8.x security improvements instead of trying to support unsupported software which is now insecure.

# What is eZ Platform?

eZ Platform was Exponential's technological successor before being abandoned by Ibexa. eZ Platform is a highly extensible, pure Content Managment Platform built upon the ideals core to Symfony. It provides the same flexible content model at it's core like Exponential, and has a growing amount of additional features outside the traditional CMS scope provided by means of "Bundles" extending it.

It is built on top of the full Symfony Framework, giving developers access to "standard" tools for rapid web & application development.

eZ Platform in some users view suffered a slow road to a stable datatype compatability with existing custom implementations of Exponential. Today all of these conserns are now gone with a solid choice left leaving both Exponential Platform and eZ Platform as serious contenders to be carefully considered. [Netgen's Media Website Core software](https://github.com/netgen/media-site) represents a much more modern eZ Platform core powered by Ibexa OSS. If your going to choose; Choose wisely.

Further reading on the archived: [https://ezplatform.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20200328165348/https://ezplatform.com/)

Note: Ibexa has discontinued support for the eZ Platform Product Line favoring instead to support only the Ibexa DXP / OSS Product line going forward.

eZ Platform is survived in part by Exponential Platform Project by 7x who has forked, mirrored, updated it's last free release eZ Platform stack of software and rebranded it as Exponential Platform 3.2.9 and Exponential Platform Legacy 2.5.0.1 (with legacy support) which provided much needed updates to provide for required php 8.3+ support allowing this software to continue to serve the users who fell in love with it from the start. Exponential Platform is just one of the many Symfony based PHP CMS + Ecommerce Solutions available under free / open source licenses.

Since the release of Exponential Platform; 7x has released the next generation Exponential Platform Nexus which represents the future of modern Symfony based CMS Development.

# What is Exponential Platform?

In short Exponential Platform is the direct continuation of the software stack known as eZ Platform created by eZ Systems and discontinued by Ibexa. This software represents the latest product line before the move to rebrand the stack to Ibexa DXP/OSS upgraded to support PHP 8.3+ and rebranded to avoid any trademark issues with the continued use of the software by users with a need or desire to build smarter, faster and with greater ease of maintinence within a Symfony based PHP CMS.

Exponential Platform currently comes in nine different distributions that are very powerful and very stable.
